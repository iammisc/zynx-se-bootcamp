Lab Part 2: Simplifying Error Handling

Now that you have refactored the original MovieTheater class into separate and
more maintainable parts, you may have noticed some fairly ugly looking nested
ifs checking for proper inputs.  We want to replace these now to make our
code look nicer and also help ourselves if we ever want to modify our
checks in the future.

To this end, we suggest you create a Validator class that contains a couple
of methods.  The first method we will call inList which takes as input
any object, any list of objects, and a string for the error message.  The
method should check if the input object is in the given list of objects,
and if not, we would like to throw an exception which contains the error
message.  The second method should do the same thing for checking if an
input float is positive.  We then leave it up to you to properly replace
the nested ifs in your other class files.
