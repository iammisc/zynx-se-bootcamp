Lab Part 4: Adding a Facade to Our Theater

Right now to make a theater run a movie, the TheaterManager has to call a whole
bunch of functions from Theater. If Theater changes at all, we would have to 
reorganize all these functions in TheaterManager. We would prefer if the 
interface of Theater to TheaterManager was simplified, and that TheaterManager
didn't have to know so much about how theater runs.

Therefore, we will make use of the facade pattern. This will consolidate all those
function calls into one public member function of TheaterFacade. This will make 
it easier to manage Theater from TheaterManager as well as decouple those two 
classes. 

Now, make a TheaterFacade class to wrap all the function calls for Theater.
