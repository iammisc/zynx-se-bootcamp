Lab Part 6: Using the Visitor Pattern

So now we want to be able to perform certain actions on the FoodStand and the 
TicketBooth classes, but we don't want our TheaterManager class to get too
bloated with all these functions to implement those actions. We also want to decouple
the theater manager from the implementation of TicketBooth and FoodStand.

To solve this, we want to make a MovieTheaterVisitor interface. Then we can simply implement 
the interface to add new functionality to TheaterManager. First make the interface
and the corresponding changes to the TicketBooth, FoodStand, and TheaterManager 
classes. Then implement one for printing out information about the stands, then 
one for restocking the stands.
