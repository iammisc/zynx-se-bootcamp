Lab Part 7: Using List Comprehension with Closures

We've added quite a bit of functionality to our theater.  Now it's time to
go back to improving our code's readability and maintainability using our
new functional programming skills.  The first step shouldn't take very long.
All we want you to do is replace those relatively verbose for loops with list
comprehension in the form of the .each method.  This will also give you a
chance to try out closures as well.
