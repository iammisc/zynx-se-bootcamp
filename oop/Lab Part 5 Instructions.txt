Lab Part 5: Using the Adaptor Pattern

We want to use a drive-in movie theater in our new MovieTheater. The problem is
that the interface for the drive-in movie theater is not the same as a regular
theater. We would like TheaterManager to treat drive-in and normal Theaters 
uniformly.

So make Theater an interface and move your original implementation into a class
that then implements the new Theater interface. Then use a new TheaterAdaptor
class to adapt the drive-in theater to be run according to the Theater interface.
