Lab Part 8: Currying with Closures

Now for the tricky part.  We want you to try out using closures in a more
sophisticated way.  For this purpose, we would like you to use currying 
and the ability to pass closures as arguments to simplify our calls to
Validator's inList method.  Our only hint is that this should reduce the 
check for if an object is in a particular list to a function of a single 
parameter. Get to it!
